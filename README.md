# R-Shiny-Experiments


This is a sample project I built to learn how to use RShiny. It is a simple set of visualizations build on the Jord√†-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database (https://www.macrohistory.net/database/). 

The RShiny app can be used here https://econ-newbie.shinyapps.io/macro_hist_app/?_ga=2.16047668.382458762.1638992374-1689395799.1635043710 (Initially requires some selected values to draw the simple plots)
